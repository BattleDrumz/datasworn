Monstrosity:
  Name: Monstrosity
  Description: |-
    Use The Monstrosity oracle to define the nature of a Nightspawn (page 125), or to introduce a new type of animal, beast, or horror in your world.

    To create a monstrosity, start by rolling for its Size and Primary Form (above). Then, roll up to four times for Characteristics (page 215) and keep up to three of those results. Do the same for Abilities (page 216).

    Give the monstrosity a rank. Choose one appropriate to its features, or use the Challenge Rank oracle (Ironsworn Core, page 190).

    Finally, envision your creation and give it a name. It’s part of your world now.

    To learn more about your creation’s nature, you can roll on additional tables. Use the Character Goal oracle (*Ironsworn Core*, page 182) to give the monstrosity a purpose. Roll on the Character Disposition and Activity oracles (page 213) to frame your initial encounter. Another roll or two can give your monstrosity nuance and complexity, making it a deeper part of your story.

      Description: |-
        Use this oracle to quickly generate a name for an Ironlander character. Roll on either table. Surnames are not used in the Ironlands and names are often gender-neutral. If a name doesn’t fit a character, or you don’t like the sound of it, look up or down a row for your answer, or reverse the digits.

        You can also ignore this oracle and use your own preferred naming conventions or name generators for your Ironland characters.

        Use this oracle when traveling to generate a point-of-interest or to answer a question about a place where someone or something can be found.

        Your roll may generate a place or geographical feature which doesn’t make sense in the context of your current location. If so, follow the guidelines on page 167 to generate a different result (look at adjacent rows or reverse the digits). Or, play off the original answer to introduce something unexpected.

        Ask this oracle for a thematic name for an Ironlander settlement. Roll once for the category, and again to pick from the examples. Alternatively, just roll for the category and come up with a name that fits the theme. In either case, consider the meaning of the name and how it impacts this settlement’s surroundings, livelihood, culture, or history. This may, in turn, inspire narrative hooks and opportunities for new quests.

        If the form of a particular word doesn’t work, try making it plural instead of singular, or vice-versa.

        If you already know the theme and domain, you can pick from the tables instead of rolling. If not, you can use these oracles to help define those aspects of the site. Use the Place oracle to roll for a domain, and let the Description and Detail oracles inform your selection of a theme.

        The site’s name might be known in your world, or it could just be an evocative label you use to understand its history and nature.

        You can use the Category oracle above to randomly select a broad type of threat for your campaign. If you are told to roll twice, take both results and decide how these two threats act together or represent a more complex situation. For example, choosing both a Malignant Plague and Zealous Cult might signify an evil sect which has unleashed a sickness upon the Ironlands in service to some dark god.

        For additional detail, use other oracles as appropriate. For example, you can look to the Action and Theme oracles (*Ironsworn Core*, page 174) or Character Goal oracle (*Ironsworn Core*, page 182) to define the motivations of a Scheming Leader.
